I've been working on some personal projects in C++ and VBA.\
Most of them are to learn and to have fun. Here are some of them:

- List of employees of an organization with many features.
- Calculator (console & Windows Forms).
- Magic number.
- [Tic Tac Toe](https://dev.to/panquesito7/how-to-create-a-tic-tac-toe-game-in-cli-c-in-windows-3l9g)
- And many, many more...
